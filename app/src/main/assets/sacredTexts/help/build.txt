Building a Game|Good job, you found the help menu! Hopefully this can clear some things up for you.  
The build screen is how you begin a new game. Firstly, you can select a map using the arrows next to the map image at the top of the screen.  Next, select the number of players to play in the game.  The players with the helmet icons under them will be human players, while the ones with the computer image under them (toggled back and forth by clicking the helmet or computer) will be controled by a totally not steam powered Artificial Intelegence.  Finaly, hitting the build button will load your newly createdv game onto the screen, ready for play.
